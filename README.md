## HW2

This Repository contains my JavaScript Game for HW2. 

The javascript and html are in two seperate files, rsc.html and mechanics.js. 

### mechanics.js
The mechanics of the game are straighforward. The computer move is generated by creating a random number between zero and two (inclusive) using that to select an item from a list of Strings containing each of the three selections. The approach to generate the random number was found at [w3 schools](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_random.asp). The user_move is generated by checking which radio button was selected. Then the moves are compared and the outcome is determined.

### rsc.html
The html page begins by linking to the bootstrap CDN in the head tag and then loading the mechanics.js (with the 'defer' keyword added to ensure the page is loaded correctly). The page then contains a standard bootstrap navbar and then a full width card that gives the user to select one of three radio buttons. Finally, there is a move button that will trigger the function contained in mechanichs.js: it reads the radio input selection, generates a computer selection and displays the result. 

### Styling
For styling, I linked to the bootstrap CDN and used some of its basic features (like navbar and cards).
